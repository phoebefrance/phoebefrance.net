				<p>Phoebe France is a Ph.D. student in the Anthropology Department at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.  Her dissertation research in archaeology focuses on Angkorian era Cambodia, where she studies archaeobotanical remains to look at long-term processes of state formation, collapse, and regeneration.  She began her graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where she received her MA and developed a strong foundation in archaeological methods and theory through the Department of Anthropology's rigorous <em>Systems</em> curriculum.  In addition to investigating long-term regional landscape histories, her research evaluates the role of archaeological ruins and interpretations of the past in nationalism, heritage politics, identity, and imagination.  She also serves as the usability advisor and web designer for the Alexandria Archive Institute and the Open Context project.  Her collaboration with AAI and Open Context is part of a series of projects that she has worked on since 2007 through Ph Labs that explore the boundaries between archaeological methods and theory, new media, and information management.
